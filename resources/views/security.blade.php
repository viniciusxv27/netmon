                        When adding the Sniffer file to your system, it is essential to be aware of some critical points related to the security and privacy of your network. Sniffer X is an advanced tool for traffic monitoring and data packet analysis, and its use requires responsibility and attention to avoid vulnerabilities or misuse.
                        <br><br>
                        Points of Attention:
                        Ethical and Legal Use:
                        Ensure that the use of Netmon complies with the local laws and regulations of your region. Monitoring third-party traffic without consent can be considered a legal violation in many countries.
                        <br><br>
                        Privacy Impact:
                        Netmon is capable of capturing sensitive data transmitted over the network. Ensure that the tool is used only for specific and authorized purposes, such as security audits or troubleshooting.
                        <br><br>
                        Risk of Exposure:
                        If not properly configured, Netmon can become a vulnerability point in your network, exposing critical information to attackers. Keep it protected with secure credentials and limited to authorized users.
                        <br><br>
                        System Protection:
                        Before implementing Netmon, ensure that system X is up-to-date and protected against external attacks. Additionally, conduct tests in a controlled environment to ensure that the tool does not compromise network performance or security.
                        <br><br>
                        Log Recording:
                        The use of Netmon generates a significant volume of logs. Ensure that they are stored in a secure location with restricted access to prevent information leaks.
                        <br><br>
                        Security Recommendations:
                        Enable encryption on all sensitive communication channels.
                        Limit access to the tool to network administrators.
                        Conduct periodic audits to verify the correct use of Netmon.
                        Consult information security experts to follow best practices.
                        Responsible use of Netmon is essential to ensure that your network remains secure while you enjoy the benefits of detailed traffic analysis.
