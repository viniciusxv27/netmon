                    <br><br>
                    Step 1: Installing Netmon
                    Download the file directly from our download page or through the system panel.
                    Install the tool following the instructions provided in the installer. Make sure you have administrative permissions to complete the installation.
                    After installation, restart the system to ensure all settings are applied correctly.
                    <br><br>
                    Step 2: Initial Configuration
                    Access Netmon from the tools menu or the Security tab of your software.
                    Add your local network and the IP address of the device you want to monitor.
                    Enable security alerts to be notified of suspicious behavior.
                    <br><br>
                    Step 3: Network Monitoring
                    Click Start Monitoring to capture traffic in real-time.
                    View the captured data in the main interface, which displays details such as source, destination, and packet type.
                    Use the analysis tools to identify potential threats or bottlenecks in the network.
                    <br><br>
                    Step 4: Security Best Practices
                    Do not monitor networks without authorization: Ensure you have permission to use the tool in the configured environment.
                    Protect captured data: Store logs in secure locations with restricted access.
                    Update the tool regularly: Make sure you are using the latest version of Netmon to take advantage of improvements and security fixes.
